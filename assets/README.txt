This directory contains placeholder video files for the demo video call system.

To create your own placeholder videos:
1. Record short (10-30 second) videos showing a doctor or patient
2. Save them as doctor-demo.mp4 and patient-demo.mp4 in this directory
3. Keep the file sizes small (under 5MB) for better performance

If no video files are present, the system will show colored placeholders instead.
